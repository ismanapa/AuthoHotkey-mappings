# Running Your AutoHotkey File On Startup

You can make a shortcut of it by right clicking on the file and selecting the “create shortcut” option.

Then open the startup folder with the “Run” window by pressing Windows key+R (or typing Run in the start menu). When the Run window starts just type “shell:startup” and hit enter.

Copy and paste the shortcut in the startup folder and restart your computer to make sure it’s working.
